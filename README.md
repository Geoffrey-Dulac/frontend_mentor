# frontend mentor test 

For a company, i passed this short integration test : 1.5 day of work.<br>

## Navbar

Cause i used to take navbar from UI Kits (bootstrap, tailwind etc...), It was the first time i made one from scratch. Cause of the timing, i'am not very happy of this component. I'll refactorize it.

## Javascript 

The only script is for the AJAX contact form and the navbar. It deserves some refacto as well.

## CSS

As much as possible i tried to use bootstrap classes, to keep .css files very clean.
